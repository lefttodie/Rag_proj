NBFCs in \nthe lowest layer shall be known as NBFC s-Base Layer (NBFC s-BL). NBFCs in middle \nlayer and upper layer shall be known as NBFCs-Middle Layer (NBFCs-ML) and NBFCs-\nUpper Layer (NBFC s-UL), respectively. The Top Layer is ideally expected to be empty \nand will be known as NBFCs-Top Layer (NBFCs-TL).  \nDetails of NBFCs populating the various layers shall be as prescribed in paragraphs 2.2 \nto paragraphs 2.6 below: \n2.2 Base Layer  \nThe Base Layer shall comprise of (a) non- deposit taking NBFCs below the asset size of \n₹1,000 crore and (b) NBFCs undertaking the following activities  - (i) NBFC-Peer to Peer \nLending Platform (NBFC -P2P), (ii) NBFC -Account Aggregator (NBFC -AA), (iii) Non -\nOperative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) and (iv) NBFC not availing public funds \nand not having any customer interface\n2. \n2.3 Middle Layer \nThe Middle Layer shall consist of (a) all deposit taking NBFCs (NBFCs-D), irrespective of \nasset size, (b) non-deposit taking NBFCs with asset size of ₹1,000 crore and above and \n(c) NBFCs undertaking the followi ng activities (i) Standalone Primary Dealer (SPD), (ii) \nInfrastructure Debt Fund- Non-Banking Financial Company (IDF-NBFC), (iii) Core \n \n1 Vide circular DOR.CRE.REC.No.60/03.10.001/2021-22 dated October 22, 2021. \n2 Public funds and customer interface as defined in these Directions.

The \ntop ten eligible NBFCs in terms of their asset size shall always reside in the upper layer, \nirrespective of any other factor. \n2.5 Top Layer  \nThe Top Layer will ideally remain empty. This layer can get populated if the Reserve Bank \nis of the opinion that there is a substantial increase in the potential systemic risk from \nspecific NBFCs in the Upper Layer. Such NBFCs shall move to the Top Layer from the \nUpper Layer. \n2.6 Categorisation of NBFCs carrying out specific activity  \nAs the regulatory structure envisages scale based as well as activity -based regulation, \nthe following prescriptions shall apply in respect of the NBFCs. \n2.6.1 NBFC-P2P, NBFC -AA, NOFHC and NBFC not availing public funds and not \nhaving any customer interface will always remain in  the Base Layer of the regulatory \nstructure. \n2.6.2 NBFC-D, CIC, NBFC-IFC and HFC will be included in Middle Layer or the Upper \nLayer (and not in the Base layer), as the case may be. SPD and IDF -NBFC will always \nremain in the Middle Layer. \n2.6.3 The remaining NBFCs, vi z., NBFC -Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC -\nICCs), NBFC -Micro Finance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs), NBFC -Factors and Mortgage \nGuarantee Companies (MGCs) could lie in any of the layers of the regulatory structure \ndepending on the parameters of the scale based regulatory framework. \n2.6.4 Government owned NBFCs shall be placed in the Base Layer or Middle Layer, \nas the case may be. They will not be placed in the Upper Layer till further notice. \n2.7 References to NBFC-ND, NBFC-ND-SI and NBFC-D  \nFrom October 01, 2022, all references to NBFC-ND (i.e., non-systemically important non-\ndeposit taking NBFC) shall mean NBFC-BL and all references to NBFC -D (i.e., deposit ",

All such non-deposit taking NBFCs shall \ncomply with the regulations/directions issued to NBFC s-ML from time to time, as and \nwhen they attain an asset size of ₹1,000 crore, irrespective of the date on which such \nsize is attained. \n2.9.2 In a dynamic environment, the asset size of a NBFCs can fall below ₹1,000 crore \nin a given month, which may be due to temporary fluctuations and not due to actual \n \n3 Existing NBFC-ND-SI having asset size of ₹500 crore and above but below ₹1000 crore (except that necessarily featuring in Middle \nLayer) will be known as NBFC-BL. \n4 Including NBFCs which will always remain in Base Layer – NBFC-P2P, NBFC-AA, NOFHC and NBFC without public funds and \ncustomer interface.

Provisioning shall \nbe required only to the extent of investment by the NBFC in the AIF scheme which is \nfurther invested by the AIF in the debtor company, and not on the entire investment of the \nNBFC in the AIF scheme. \n \n(2) In addition, investment by NBFCs in the subordinated units of any AIF scheme with a \n‘priority distribution model’ shall be subject to full deduction from capital funds of NBFCs.  \nSuch deduction from capital shall take place equally from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\n \n \n \n19 Vide circular DOR.STR.REC.58/21.04.048/2023-24 dated December 19, 2023 and circular DOR.STR.REC.85/21.04.048/2023-24 \ndated March 27, 2024.

No potential future exposure  shall be calculated for single currency floating/ \nfloating interest rate swaps; the credit exposure on these contracts would be evaluated \nsolely on the basis of their mark-to-market value.  \n4.  Potential future exposures shall be based on 'effective' rather than 'apparent \nnotional amounts'. In the event that the 'stated notional amount' is leveraged or enhanced \nby the structure of the transaction, the 'effective notional amount' must be used for \ndetermining potential future exposure. For example, a stated notional amount of USD 1 \nmillion with payments based on an internal rate of two times the lending rate of the NBFC \nwould have an effective notional amount of USD 2 million.  \n85.4.3 When effective bilateral netting contract as specified in paragraph 85.4.5 is in \nplace, current exposure, i.e., replacement cost will be the net replacement cost; and the \npotential future exposure, i.e., add-on will be ANet as calculated below: \n(i) Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forward transactions will be calculated as the sum \nof the net mark -to-market replacement cost, if positive, plus an add- on based on the \nnotional underlying principal. \nThe add-on for netted transactions (A Net) will equa l the weighted average of the gross \nadd-on (AGross) and the gross add-on adjusted by the ratio of net current replacement cost \nto gross current replacement cost (NGR). This is expressed through the following formula: \nANet = 0.4 * AGross + 0.6 * NGR * AGross \nwhere: \nNGR = level of net replacement cost/level of gross replacement cost for \ntransactions subject to legally enforceable netting agreements41 \nAGross = sum of individual add- on amounts (calculated by multiplying the \nnotional principal amount by the appr opriate add-on factors set out in the \ntable in paragraph 85.4.2 of all transactions subject to legally enforceable \nnetting agreements with one counterparty. \n \n41 NBFCs must calculate NGR on a counterparty by counterparty basis for all transactions that are subject to l egally enforceable \nnetting agreements. \n ",

The reason for this is that \noffsetting contracts in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower \npotential future exposure as well as lower current exposure. \n85.4.4 Definitions and general terminology \n(i) Current Exposure is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or portfolio \nof transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default \nof the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in \nbankruptcy. Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost (RC). \n(ii) Netting Set is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is recognised for \nregulatory capital purposes. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceabl e \nbilateral netting arrangement that is recognised for regulatory capital purposes should be \ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules. \n85.4.5 Requirement for recognition of Bilateral Netting Contract \n(i) NBFCs may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation between \nsuch NB FC and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is \nautomatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value \ndate, legally substituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations. \n(ii) NBFCs may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilateral netting \nnot covered in (i), including other forms of novation. \n(iii) In both cases (i) and (ii), NBFCs will need to satisfy that it has: \n(a) A netting contract or agreement with the counterparty which creates a single legal \nobligation, covering all included transactions, such that the NB FCs would have either a \nclaim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-\nto-market values of included individual transactions in the event a counterparty fails to \nperform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar \ncircumstances; ",

How \nwill these NBFCs be classified in various layers? \nExplanation – On a standalone basis, as per SBR Regulatory Framework,  \n•  HFCs and IFCs will, by default, be included in the Middle Layer but may move to the \nUpper Layer based on the supervisory filtering process. \n•  NBFC-ICC and NBFC- MFI will be classified in Base Layer (as their asset size \nconstitutes less than ₹1000 crore in the example). \n•  NBFC-P2P and NBFC without public funds and customer interface will, by default, be \nincluded in the Base Layer. \nBased on consolidation of assets of all the NBFCs in the Group, the consolidated asset \nsize of NBFCs in the Group becomes ₹1320 crore (higher than the asset size threshold \nof ₹1000 crore for classification in Middle Layer). As such, NBFC-ICC and NBFC-MFI will \nbe classified in the Middle Layer. HFC and IFC will continue to be classified in the Middle \nLayer in this example. However, NBFC-P2P and NBFC without public funds and customer \ninterface will continue to be classified in the Base Layer. \nExample 2 - If the asset size of NBFC-ICC in the above example is ₹10 crore, then would \nit be still classified in Middle Layer? \nExplanation - Yes, both NBFC -ICC and NBFC -MFI would still be classified in Middle \nLayer as the consolidated asset size of NBFCs in the Group at ₹1030 crore is higher than \nthe asset size threshold of ₹1000 crore for Middle Layer.  \n ",

The Reserve Bank, expects a high-\nquality implementation of Ind AS which will require detailed analysis, application of \njudgment and detailed documentation to s upport judgments. These guidelines focus on \nthe need to ensure consistency in the application of the accounting standards in specific \nareas, including asset classification and provisioning, and provide clarifications on \nregulatory capital in the light of I nd AS implementation. It may be noted that these \ninstructions and guidelines relate to specific prudential aspects of Ind AS implementation \nby NBFCs and are not meant to provide a comprehensive commentary on the accounting \nstandards or comprehensive techni cal interpretation of the standards, nor intended to \ncover all possible situations. Accordingly, with respect to matters not dealt with in Annex \nII, NBFCs are required to refer to the notified accounting standards, application guidance, \neducational material and other clarifications issued by the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of India (ICAI). \n1.  Governance Framework \n1.1  In view of the criticality of the nature of the business model in determining the \nclassification of financial assets and restrictions  on subsequent reclassification, NBFCs \nare advised to put in place Board approved policies that clearly articulate and document \ntheir business models and portfolios. NBFCs shall also articulate the objectives for \nmanaging each portfolio. \n1.2  NBFCs shall f rame their policy for sales out of amortised cost business model \nportfolios and disclose the same in their notes to financial statements. \n1.3  The Reserve Bank expects the Board of Directors to approve sound \nmethodologies\n65 for computation of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) that address policies, \n \n64 NBFCs that are required to implement Ind AS in terms of Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended from \ntime to time. \n65NBFCs may draw reference to Guidance on Credit Risk and Accounting for Expected Credit Losses issued by Basel Committee on \nBanking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2015, which is structured around 11 principles out of which first eight principles deal with ",

The \nparameters and assumptions considered as well  as their sensitivity to the ECL output \nshould be documented. NBFCs are advised to not make changes in the parameters, \nassumptions and other aspects of their ECL model for the purposes of profit smoothening. \nThe rationale and justification for any change i n the ECL model should be documented \nand approved by the Board. Similarly, any adjustments to the model output (i.e. a \nmanagement overlay) should be approved by the Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) \nand its rationale and basis should be clearly documented. \n1.4  Ind AS 109 does not explicitly define default\n66, but requires entities to define \ndefault in a manner consistent with that used for internal credit risk management. It is \nrecommended that the definition of default adopted for accounting purposes is guided by \nthe definition used for regulatory purposes. The ACB should approve the classification of \naccounts that are past due beyond 90 days but not treated as impaired, with the rationale \nfor the same clearly documented. Further, the number of such accounts and the total \namount outstanding and the overdue amounts should be disclosed in the notes to the \nfinancial statements. \n1.5  Regardless of the way in which the NBFC assesses significant increase in credit \nrisk, there is a rebuttable presumption under Ind AS 109 that the credit risk on a financial \nasset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are \nmore than 30 days past due. Ind AS 109 also permits that an NBFC can rebut this \npresumption if it has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates that the \ncredit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition even though the \ncontractual payments are more than 30 days past due. NBFCs should educate their \ncustomers on the need to make payments in a timely manner. However, in limited \ncircumstances, where NBFCs do rebut the presumption, it should be done only with clear \n \nsupervisory guidance and inter -alia cover Board/Senior Management’s responsibilities, adoption of sound methodologies for credit \nrisk measurement, disclosure requirements etc. \n66Paragraph B5.5.37 of Ind AS 109 states that “…an entity shall apply a default definition that is consistent with the definition used for \ninternal credit risk management purposes for the relevant financial instrument and consider qualitative indicators (for example, financial \ncovenants) when appropriate. However, there is a rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later than when a financial asset \nis 90 days past due unless an entity has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion \nis more appropriate. The definition of default used for these purposes shall be applied consistently to all financial instruments unless \ninformation becomes av ailable that demonstrates that another default definition is more appropriate for a particular financial \ninstrument.”   ",

Accordingly, the following asset \nclassification norms shall apply to the project loans before commencement of commercial \noperations. \nFor this purpose, all project loans have been divided into the following two categories: \n(i) Project Loans for infrastructure sector \n(ii) Project Loans for non-infrastructure sector \nFor the purpose of these Directions, 'Project Loan' shall mean any term loan which has \nbeen extended for the purpose of setting up of an economic venture.

Such CRE project loans shall be treated as standard assets \nin all respects for this purpose without attracting the higher provisioning applicable for \nrestructured standard assets. However, the asset classification benefit shall not be \navailable to CRE projects if they are restructured. \n3.5.3  In all the above cases of restructuring where regulatory forbearance has been \nextended, the Boards of NBFCs shall satisfy themselves about the viability of the project \nand the restructuring plan. \n3.6  Income recognition \n3.6.1  NBFCs shall recognise income on accrual basis in respect of the projects under \nimplementation, which are classified as 'standard'. \n3.6.2  NBFCs shall no t recognise income on accrual basis in respect of the projects \nunder implementation which are classified as a 'substandard' asset.

If, however, the amount of funded interest \nis recognised as income, a provision for an equal amount shall also be made \nsimultaneously. In other words, any funding of interest in respect of NPAs, if recognized \nas income, shall be fully provided for. ",

Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) Mechanism \n1.1  Objective \nThe objective of the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) framework is to ensure timely \nand transparent mechanism for restructuring the corporate debts of viable entities facing \nproblems, outside the purview of BIFR, DRT and other legal proceedings, for the benefit \nof all concerned. In particular, the framework shall aim at preserving viable corporates \nthat are affected by certain internal and external factors and minimize the losses to the \ncreditors and other stakeholders through an orderly and coordinated r estructuring \nprogramme. \n1.2  Scope \nThe CDR Mechanism has been designed to facilitate restructuring of advances of \nborrowers enjoying credit facilities from more than one bank/Financial Institution (FI) in a \ncoordinated manner. The CDR Mechanism is an organizational framework \ninstitutionalized for speedy disposal of restructuring proposals of large borrowers availing \nfinance from more than one bank/FI. This mechanism shall be available to all borrowers \nengaged in any type of activity subject to the following conditions: \n(i) The borrowers enjoy credit facilities from more than one bank/FI under multiple \nbanking/syndication/consortium system of lending. \n(ii) The total outstanding (fund- based and non- fund based) exposure is ₹10 crore or \nabove. \nCDR system in the country shall have a three-tier structure: \n•    CDR Standing Forum and its Core Group \n•    CDR Empowered Group \n•    CDR Cell \n2.

The CDR mechanism shall cover only multiple banking accounts/syndication/ \nconsortium accounts of corporate borrowers engaged in any type of activity with \noutstanding fund-based and non-fund based exposure of ₹10 crore and above by banks \nand institutions. \n5.1.2  The Category 1 CDR system shall be applicable only to accounts classified as \n'standard' and 'sub-standard'. There may be a situation where a small portion of debt by \na bank might be classified as doubtful. In that situation, if the account has been classified \nas 'standard'/'substandard' in the books of at least 90 percent of creditors (by value), the \nsame shall be treated as standard/substandard, only for the purpose of judging the \naccount as eligible for CDR, in the books of the remaining 10 percent of creditors.

However, potentially viable cases \nof NPAs will get priority. This approach shall provide the necessary flexibility and facilitate \ntimely intervention for debt restructuring.

Such \nexceptional cases shall be admitted for restructuring with the approval of the Core Group \nonly.

The debtors shall have to accede to the DCA, either at the time of \noriginal loan documentation (for future cases) or at the time of reference to Corporate \nDebt Restructuring Cell. Similarly, all participants in the CDR mechanism through their \nmembership of the Standing Forum shall have to enter into a legally binding agreement, \nwith necessary enforcement and penal clauses, to operate the System through laid-down \npolicies and guidelines. The ICA signed by the creditors shall be initially valid for a period \nof three years and subject to renewal for further periods of three  years thereafter. The \nlenders in foreign currency outside the country are not a part of CDR system. Such \ncreditors and also creditors like GIC, LIC, UTI, etc., who have not joined the CDR system, \ncould join CDR mechanism of a particular corporate by signing transaction to transaction \nICA, wherever they have exposure to such corporate. \n5.3.2  The Inter-Creditor Agreement shall be a legally binding agreement amongst the \ncreditors, with necessary enforcement and penal clauses, wherein the creditors shall \ncommit themselves to abide by the various elements of CDR system. Further, the \ncreditors shall agree that if 75 percent of creditors by value and 60 percent of the creditors \nby number, agree to a restructuring package of an existing debt (i.e., debt outstanding), \nthe same shall be binding on the remaining creditors. Since Category 1 CDR Scheme \ncovers only standard and substandard accounts, which in the opinion of 75 percent of the \ncreditors by value and 60 percent of creditors by number, are likely to become performing \nafter introduction of the CDR package, it is expected that all other creditors (i.e., those \noutside the minimum 75 percent by value and 60 percent by number) shall be willing to \nparticipate in the entire CDR package, including the agreed additional financing. \n5.3.3  In order to improve effectiveness of the CDR mechanism a clause shall be \nincorporated in the loan agreements involving consortium/syndicate accounts whereby \nall creditors, including those which are not members of the CDR mechanism, agree to be \nbound by the terms of the restructuring package that shall be approved under the CDR \nmechanism, as and when restructuring may become necessary.

The new \nlenders shall rank on par with the existing lenders for repayment and servicing of the dues \nsince they have taken over the existing dues to the exiting lender. \n5.5.4  In order to bring more flexibility in the exit option, One Time Settlement can also \nbe considered, wherever necessary, as a part of the restructuring package. If an account \nwith any creditor is subjected to One Time Settlement (OTS) by a borrower before its \nreference to the CDR mechanism, any fulfilled commitments under such OTS shall not \nbe reversed under the restruct ured package.

The \nintention is not to encourage a particular resolution option, e.g. restructuring or recovery, \nbut to arrive at an early and feasible solution to preserve the economic value of the \nunderlying assets as well as the lenders’ loans. The options under CAP by the JLF shall \ngenerally include: \n2.1.1  Rectification - Obtaining a specific commitment from the borrower to regularise \nthe account so that the account comes out of SMA status or does not slip into the NPA \ncategory. The commitment shall be supported with identifiable cash flows within the \nrequired time period and without involving any loss or sacrifice on the part of the existing \nlenders. If the existing promoters are not in a position to bring in additional money or take \nany measures to regularise the account, the possibility of getting some other \nequity/strategic investors to the company may be explored by the JLF in consultation with \nthe borrower. These measures are intended to turn- around the entity/company without \nany change in terms and conditions of the loan. The JLF may also consider providing \nneed based additional fi nance to the borrower, if considered necessary, as part of the \nrectification process. However, it shall be strictly ensured that additional financing is not \nprovided with a view to evergreening the account. \n2.1.2  Restructuring - Consider the possibility of restructuring the account if it is prima \nfacie viable and there is no diversion of funds, fraud or malfeasance, etc. At this stage, \ncommitment from promoters for extending their personal guarantees along with their net \nworth statement supported by copies of legal titles to assets may be obtained along with \na declaration that they shall not undertake any transaction that shall alienate assets \nwithout the permission of the JLF. Any deviation from the commitment by the borrowers \naffecting the security/recoverability of the loans may be treated as a valid factor for \ninitiating recovery process. For this action to be sustainable, the lenders in the JLF may \nsign an Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA) and also require the borrower to sign the Debtor \nCreditor Agreement  (DCA) which shall provide the legal basis for any restructuring \nprocess. The formats used by the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) mechanism for \nICA and DCA could be considered, if necessary with appropriate changes.

The ICA may also stipulate that both secured and \nunsecured creditors need to agree to the final resolution. \n2.1.3  Recovery - Once the first two options at paragraphs 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 above are \nseen as not feasible, due recovery process may be resorted to. The JLF may decide the \nbest recovery process to be followed, among the various legal and other recovery options \navailable, with a view to optimise the efforts and results. \n2.2 The decisions agreed upon by a minimum of 75 percent of creditors by value and \n60 percent of creditors by number in the JLF shall be considered as the basis for \nproceeding with the restructuring of the account, and shall be binding on all lenders under \nthe terms of the ICA. However, if the JLF decides to proceed with recovery, the minimum \ncriteria for binding decision, if any, under any relevant laws/Acts would be applicable. \n2.3 The JLF is required to arrive at an agreement on the option to be adopted for \nCAP within 30 days from (i) the date of an account being reported as SMA -2 by one or \nmore lender, or (ii) receipt of request from the borrower to form a JLF, with substantiated \ngrounds, if it senses imminent stress. The JLF shall sign off the detailed final CAP within \nthe next 30 days from the date of arriving at such an agreement. \n2.4 If the JLF decides on options at paragraph 2.1.1 or 2.1.2, but the account fails to \nperform as per the agreed terms under either of these option s, the JLF shall initiate \nrecovery under option at paragraph 2.1.3. \n3.

Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) \nmechanism is an institutional framework for restructuring of multiple/consortium advances \nof banks and NBFCs where even creditors who are not part of CDR system can join by \nsigning transaction to transaction based agreements. \n3.2 If the JLF decides restructuring of the account as CAP, it shall have the option of \neither referring the account to CDR Cell after a decision to restructure is taken under \nparagraph 2.1 as indicated above or restructure the same independent of the CDR \nmechanism.

The JLF and CDR Cell shall optimally utilise the s pecified time periods so \nthat the aggregate time limit is not breached under any mode of restructuring. If the \nJLF/CDR takes a shorter time for an activity as against the prescribed limit, then it can \nhave the discretion to utilise the saved time for other  activities provided the aggregate \ntime limit is not breached. \n4.3 The general principle of restructuring shall be that the shareholders bear the first \nloss rather than the debt holders. With this principle in view and also to ensure more ‘skin \nin the game’ of promoters, JLF/CDR may consider the following options when a loan is \nrestructured: \n(i) Possibility of transferring equity of the company by promoters to the lenders to \ncompensate for their sacrifices; \n(ii) Promoters infusing more equity into their companies; \n(iii) Transfer of the promoters’ holdings to a security trustee or an escrow arrangement till \nturnaround of company.

For unlisted companies, the JLF shall have option \nof either getting equities issued or incorporate suitable ‘right to recompense’ clause. \n4.6 In order to distinguish the differential security interest available to secured \nlenders, partially secured lenders and unsecured lenders, the JLF/CDR could consider \nvarious options like: \n(i)  Prior agreement in the ICA among the above classes of lenders regarding repayments, \nsay, as per an agreed waterfall mechanism; \n(ii)  A structured agreement stipulating priority of secured creditors; \n(iii) Appropriation of repayment proceeds among secured, partially secured and \nunsecured lenders in certain pre-agreed proportion. \nThe above is only an illustrative list and the JLF may decide on a mutually agreed option. \nIt also needs to be emphasised that while one lender may have a better security interest \nwhen it comes to one bor rower, the case may be vice versa in the case of another \nborrower. So, it shall be beneficial if lenders appreciate the concerns of fellow lenders \nand arrive at a mutually agreed option with a view to preserving the economic value of \nassets.

Currency Risk \nExchange rate volatility imparts a new dimension to the risk profile of an NBFCs’ balance \nsheets having foreign assets or liabilities. The Board of NBFCs should recognise the \nliquidity risk arising out of such exposures and develop suitable preparedness for \nmanaging the risk. \n7. Managing Interest Rate Risk (IRR) \n7.1 The operational flexibility given to NBFCs in pricing most of the assets and \nliabilities imply the need for the financial system to hedge the Interest Rate Risk. Interest \nrate risk is the risk where changes in market interest rates might adversely affect an \nNBFC's financial condition. The changes in interest rates affect NBFCs in a larger way . \nThe immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on NBFC's earnings (i.e. reported \nprofits) by changing its Net Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changing interest \nrates is on NBFC's Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net Worth as the economic value of \nNBFC's assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions get affected due to variation in \nmarket interest rates. The interest rate risk when viewed from these two perspectives is \nknown as ‘earnings perspective’ and ‘economic value perspective', respectively. The risk \nfrom the earnings perspective can be measured as changes in the Net Interest Income \n(NII) or Net Interest Margin (NIM). There are many analytical techniques for measurement \nand management of Interest Rate Risk. To begin with, the T raditional Gap A nalysis is \nconsidered as a suitable method to measure the Interest Rate Risk in the first place. It is \n \n72 Less than one year ",

Gap analysis measures mismatches between rate \nsensitive liabilities and rate sensitive assets (including off-balance sheet positions). An \nasset or liability is normally classified as rate sensitive if: \n(i) within the time interval under consideration, there is a cash flow;  \n(ii) the interest rate resets/reprices contractually during the interval; \n(iii) dependent on changes of the Reserve Bank in the interest rates/Bank Rate; \n(iv) it is contractually pre-payable or withdrawal before the stated maturities. \n7.3 The Gap Report shall be generated by grouping rate sensitive liabilities, assets \nand off-balance sheet positions into time buckets according to residual maturity or next \nrepricing period, whichever is earlier. The difficult task in Gap analysis is determining rate \nsensitivity. All investments, advances, deposits, borrowings, purchased funds, etc. that \nmature/reprice within a specified timeframe are interest rate sensitive. Similarly, any \nprincipal repayment of loan is also rate sensitive if the NBFC expects  to receive it within \nthe time horizon. This includes final principal payment and interim instalments. Certain \nassets and liabilities to receive/pay rates that vary with a reference rate. These assets \nand liabilities are repriced at pre- determined intervals and are rate sensitive at the time \nof repricing. While the interest rates on term deposits are fixed during their currency, the \ntranches of advances portfolio are  basically floating. The interest rates on advances \nreceived could be repriced any number of  occasions, corresponding to the changes in \nPrime Lending Rate (PLR).  \n7.4 The Gaps may be identified in the following time buckets: \n(i) 1 day to 7 days \n(ii) 8 days to 14 days \n(iii) 15 days -30/ 31 days (one month) \n(iv) Over one month to 2 months \n(v) Over two months to 3 months ",

The positive Gap indicates that it has \nmore RSAs than RSLs whereas the negative Gap indicates that it has more RSLs than \nRLAs. The Gap reports indicate whether the institution is in a position to benefit from \nrising interest rates by having a positive Gap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a position to \nbenefit from declining interest rates by a negative Gap (RSL > RSA). The Gap can, \ntherefore, be used as a measure of interest rate sensitivity.  \n7.6  Each NBFC shall set prudential limits on individual Gaps with the approval of the \nBoard/Management Committee. The prudential limits shall have a relationship with the \nTotal Assets, Earning Assets or Equity. The NBFCs may work out Earnings at Risk (EaR) \nor Net Interest Margin (NIM) based on their views on interest rate movements and fix a \nprudent level with the approval of the Board/Management Committee.

NBFCs which are better \nequipped to reasonably estimate the behavioural pattern of various components of assets \nand liabilities on the basis of past data/empirical studies could classify them in the \nappropriate time buckets, subject to approval from the ALCO/Board.

'Outsourcing' is defined as the NBFC’s use of a third party (either an affiliated \nentity within a corporate group or an entity that is external to the corporate group) to \nperform activities on a continuing basis that would normally be undertaken by the NBF C \nitself, now or in the future.  \n‘Continuing basis' includes agreements for a limited period. \n1.2. NBFCs have been outsourcing various activities and are hence exposed to \nvarious risks as detailed in paragraph 5.3. Further, the outsourced activities are to be \nbrought within regulatory purview to a) protect the interest of the customers of NBFCs \nand b) to ensure that the concerned NBFC and the Reserve Bank have access to all \nrelevant books, records and information available with service provider. Typically \noutsourced financial services include applications processing (loan origination, credit \ncard), document processing, marketing and research, supervision of loans, data \nprocessing and back office related activities, besides others. \n1.3. Some key risks in outsourcing ar e Strategic Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance \nRisk, Operational Risk, Legal Risk, Exit Strategy Risk, Counterparty Risk, Country Risk, \nContractual Risk, Access Risk, Concentration and Systemic Risk. The failure of a service \nprovider in providing a specifie d service, a breach in security/confidentiality, or non-\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements by the service provider can lead to \nfinancial losses or loss of reputation for the NBFC and could also lead to systemic risks.  \n1.4. It is therefore imperative for the NBFC outsourcing its activities to ensure sound \nand responsive risk management practices for effective oversight, due diligence and \nmanagement of risks arising from such outsourced activities. The instruc tions are \napplicable to material outsourcing arrangements as explained in paragraph 3 which may \nbe entered into by an NBFC with a service provider located in India or elsewhere. The \nservice provider may either be a member of the group/conglomerate to which the NBFC \nbelongs, or an unrelated party. ",

The underlying principles behind these instruc tions are that the regulated entity \nshall ensure that outsourcing arrangements neither diminish its ability to fulfil its \nobligations to customers and the Reserve Bank  nor impede effective supervision by the  \nReserve Bank. NBFCs, therefore, have to take steps to ensure that the service provider \nemploys the same high standard of care in performing the services as is expected to be \nemployed by the NBFCs, if the activities were conducted within the NBFCs and not \noutsourced. Accordingly, NBFCs shall not engage in outsourcing that would result in their \ninternal control, business conduct or reputation being compromised or weakened. \n1.6. (i) These instructi ons are concerned with managing risks in outsourcing of \nfinancial services and are not applicable to technology -related issues and activities not \nrelated to financial services, such as usage of courier, catering of staff, housekeeping and \njanitorial services, security of the premises, movement and archiving of records, etc. \nNBFCs which desire to outsource financial services would not require prior approval from \nthe Reserve Bank . However, such arrangements would be subject to on- site/off-site \nmonitoring and inspection/scrutiny by the Reserve Bank. \n (ii) With regard to outsourced services relating to credit cards, detailed \ninstructions of the Reserve Bank contained in \n‘Master Direction – Credit Card and Debit \nCard – Issuance and Conduct Directions, 2022’, dated April 21, 2022, as  amended from \ntime to time, would be applicable. \n2. Activities that shall not be outsourced \nNBFCs which choose to outsource financial services shall, however, not outsource core \nmanagement functions including Internal Audit, Strategic and Compliance functions and \ndecision-making functions such as determining compliance with KYC norms for opening \ndeposit accounts, according sanction for loans (including retail loans) and management \nof investment portfolio . However, for NBFCs in a group/conglomerate, these functions \nmay be outsourced within the group subject to compliance with instructions in paragraph \n6. Further, w hile internal audit function itself is a management process, the internal \nauditors can be on contract. \n \n \n ",

Material Outsourcing \nFor the purpose of these instruc tions, material outsourcing arrangements are those \nwhich, if disrupted, have the potential to significantly impact the business operations, \nreputation, profitability or customer service. Materiality of outsourcing would be based on: \n(i) the level of importance to the NBFC of the activity being outsourced as well as the \nsignificance of the risk posed by the same; \n(ii)  the potential impact of the outsourcing on the NBFC on various parameters such as \nearnings, solvency, liquidity, funding capital and risk profile; \n(iii) the likely impact on the NBFC’s reputation and brand value, and ability to achieve its \nbusiness objectives, strategy and pl ans, should the service provider fail to perform the \nservice; \n(iv) the cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs of the NBFC; \n(v)  the aggregate exposure to that particular service provider, in cases where the NBFC \noutsources various functions to the same service provider and \n(vi) the significance of activities outsourced in context of customer service and protection. \n4. NBFC's role and Regulatory and Supervisory Requirements \n4.1 The outsourcing of any activity by NBFC does not diminish its obligations, and \nthose of its Board and senior management, who have the ultimate responsibility for the \noutsourced activity. NBFCs would therefore be responsible for the actions of their service \nprovider including Direct Sales Agents/Direct Marketing Agents and recovery agents and \nthe confidentiality of information pertaining to the customers that is available with the \nservice provider. NBFCs shall retain ultimate control of the outsourced activity. \n4.2 It is imperative for the NBFC, when performing its due diligence in relation to \noutsourcing, to consider all relevant laws, regulations, guidelines and conditions of \napproval, licensing or registration. \n4.3 Outsourcing arrangements shall not affect the rights of a customer against the \nNBFC, including the ability of the customer to obtain redress as applicable under relevant \nlaws. In cases where the customers are required to deal with the service providers in the \nprocess of dealing with the NBFC, NBFCs shall incorporate a clause in the relative \nproduct literature/brochures, etc., st ating that they may use the services of agents in \nsales/marketing etc. of the products.

The payment shall be only in the form of physical settlement \n(payment of par in exchange for physical delivery of a deliverable obligation).  \n(ii) Underlying asset/obligation – The asset which a protection buyer is seeking to \nhedge.  \n(iii) Deliverable asset/ obligation – any obligation78 of the reference entity which shall \nbe delivered, under the terms of the contract, if a credit event occurs. (Assets under this \nclause will rank at least pari-passu or junior to the underlying obligation).  \n(iv) Reference obligation - the obligation79 used to calculate the amount payable when \na credit event occurs under the terms of a credit derivative contract. [A reference \nobligation is relevant for obligations that are to be cash settled (on a par -less-recovery \nbasis)].   \n2. Operational requirements for CDS \n2.1. A CDS contract shall represent a direct claim on the protection seller and shall \nbe explicitly referenced to specific exposure, so that the extent of the cover is clearly \ndefined and incontrovertible.  \n2.2. Other than non-payment by a protection buyer of premium in respect of the credit \nprotection contract, it shall be irrevocable.                                                             \n2.3. There shall be no clause in the contract that shall allow the protection seller \nunilaterally to cancel the credit cover or that would increase the effective cost of cover as \na result of deteriorating credit quality in the hedged exposure.  \n2.4. The CDS contract shall be unconditional; there shall be no clause in the protection \ncontract outside the direct control of the NBFC that could prevent the protection seller \n \n78 As per ‘Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Credit Derivatives) Directions, 2022’ dated February 10, 2022. \n79 As per ‘Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Credit Derivatives) Directions, 2022’ dated February 10, 2022. \n ",

If the amount of the CDS is less than or equal to the amount of the underlying \nobligation, 60 percent of the amount of the hedge can be recognised as covered. If the \namount of the CDS  is larger than that of the underlying obligation, then the amount of \neligible hedge is capped at 60 percent of the amount of the underlying obligation.  \n2.6. If the CDS specifies deliverable obligations that are different from the underlying \nobligation, the resultant asset mismatch shall be governed under paragraph 2.10.  \n2.7.

If the protection buyer’s right/ability to transfer the underlying obligation to the \nprotection seller is required for settlement, the terms of the underlying obligation shall \nprovide that any required consent to such transfer may not be unreasonably withheld. \n2.9. The identity of the parties responsible for determining whether a credit event has \noccurred shall be clearly defined. This determination shall not be the sole responsibility \nof the protection seller. The protection buyer shall have the right/ability to inform the \nprotection seller of the occurrence of a credit event.  \n \n80 Definition of maturity – the maturity of the underlying exposure and the maturity of the hedge shall both be defined conservatively. \nThe effective maturity of the underlying shall be gauged as the longest possible remaining time before the counterparty is scheduled \nto fulfill its obligation, taking into account any applicable grace period.

Therefore, NBFCs shall restrict the total exposure to an obligor including \nthat covered by way of CDS within an internal exposure ceiling considered appropriate \nby the Board of the NBFC in such a way that it shall not breach the single/group borrower \nexposure limit prescribed by the Reserve Bank. In case of the event of any breach in the \nsingle/group borrower exposure limit, the entire exposure in excess of the limit will be risk \nweighted at 667 percent. In order to ensure that consequent upon such a treatment, the \nNBFC shall not breach the minimum capital requirement prescribed by the Reserve Bank, \nit shall keep sufficient cushion in capital in case it assumes exposures in excess of normal \nexposure limit.

        "text": "-320- \n \nAnnex XXIV  \nGuidelines on Compensation of Key Managerial Personnel and Senior \nManagement in NBFCs: Minimum Scope and coverage \n1. Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) \nThe Boards of NBFCs shall constitute a Nomination and Remuneration Committee \n(NRC). The NRC shall have the constitution, powers, functions and duties as laid down \nin section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013. The NRC,  inter alia,  shall also have the \nmandate to oversee the framing, review and implementation of compensation policy of \nthe company which should have the approval of the board. The NRC may work in close \ncoordination with Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the company to achieve \neffective alignment between compensation and risks. Further, the NRC may ensure that \ncompensation levels are supported by the need to retain earnings of the company and \nthe need to maintain adequate capital based on ICAAP. NRC may also ensure ‘fit and \nproper’ status of proposed/existing directors and that there is no conflict of interest in \nappointment of directors on Board of the company, KMPs and senior management. \n2.  Principles for compensation \n2.1 Components and risk alignment:  The compensation of Key Managerial \nPersonnel (KMPs) and senior management needs to be reasonable, recognising all  \nrelevant factors including adherence to statutory requirements and industry practices. The \ncompensation packages may comprise of fixed and variable pay components aligned \neffectively with prudent risk taking to ensure that compensation is adjusted for all  types \nof risks, the compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes, compensation \npay-outs are sensitive to the time horizon of the risks, and the mix of cash, equity and \nother forms of compensation are consistent with risk alignment. \n2.2 Composition of Fixed Pay:  All the fixed items of compensation, including the \nperquisites and contributions towards superannuation/retiral benefits, may be treated as \npart of fixed pay. All perquisites that are reimbursable may also be included in the fixed  ",

Monetary \nequivalent of benefits of non- monetary nature (such as free furnished house, use of \ncompany car, etc.) may also be part of fixed pay. \n2.3 Principles for Variable Pay \n2.3.1 Composition of Variable Pay:  The variable pay may be in the form of share-\nlinked instruments, or a mix of cash and share-linked instruments. It shall be ensured that \nthe share-linked instruments are in conformity with relevant statutory provisions. \n2.3.2 Proportion: The proportion of variable pay in total compensation 90 needs to be \ncommensurate with the role and prudent risk taking profile of KMPs/senior management. \nAt higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay needs to be higher. There \nshould be proper balance between the cash and share-linked instruments in the variable \npay in case the variable pay contains share linked instruments. The variable pay should \nbe truly and effectively variable and can be reduced to zero based on performance at an \nindividual, business -unit and company -wide level. In order to do so, performance \nmeasures and their relation to remuneration packages should be clearly defined at the \nbeginning of the performance measurement period to ensure that the employees perceive \nthe incentive mechanism. \n2.3.3 Deferral of variable pay:  Not all the variable pay awarded after performance \nassessment may be paid immediately. Certain portion of variable pay, as decided by the \nBoard of the company, may be deferred to time horizon of the risks. The portion of deferral \narrangement may be made applicable for both cash and non- cash components of the \nvariable pay. Deferral period for such an arrangement may be decided by the Board of \nthe company. \n2.3.4 Control and assurance function personnel:  KMPs and senior management \nengaged in financial control, risk management, compliance and internal audit may be \ncompensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas they oversee and \n \n90 Total compensation includes fixed and variable pay ",

However, a reasonable proportion of \ncompensation may be in the form of variable pay, so that exercising the options of malus \nand/or clawback, when warranted, is not rendered infructuous. \n3. Guaranteed bonus \nGuaranteed bonus may not be paid to KMPs and senior management. However, in the \ncontext of new hiring joining/sign-on bonus could be considered. Such bonus will neither \nbe considered part of fixed pay nor of variable pay. \n \n4. Malus/Clawback \nThe deferred compensation may be subject to malus 91/clawback92 arrangements in the \nevent of subdued or negative financial performance of the company and/or the relevant \nline of business or employee misconduct in any year. A representative set of situations \nmay be identified by the NBFC, which require them to invoke the malus and clawback \nclauses that may be applicable on entire variable pay. While setting criteria for the \napplication of malus and clawback, NBFCs may also specify a period during which malus \nand/or clawback can be applied, covering at least the deferral and retention periods93. \n \n \n  \n \n91 A malus arrangement permits the NBFC to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus \narrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred. \n92A clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the NBFC in which the employee agrees to return previously paid \nor vested remuneration to the NBFC under certain circumstances. \n93 Retention period: A period of time after the vesting of instruments which have been awarded as variable pay during which they  \ncannot be sold or accessed.
